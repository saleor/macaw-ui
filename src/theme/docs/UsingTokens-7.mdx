# Using tokens

MacawUI is implemented by using the concept of design tokens.
Each token holds the value of a given CSS property (or group of properties),
and it's delivered as a CSS variable in the runtime.

#### Token example

An example of a token can be `color` or `font-size`. Having these defined as variables:

```css
--mu-font-size-title-medium: 10px;
--mu-colors-foreground-text-critical-default: red;
--mu-colors-foreground-text-neutral-defailt: white;
```

We can create many variations of our text. Please notice that name of the tokens represents some of the intentions.

```css
.text-error {
  color: var(--mu-colors-foreground-text-critical-default)
  font-size: var(--mu-font-size-title-medium)
}

.text-neutral {
  color: var(--mu-colors-foreground-text-neutral-defailt)
  font-size: var(--mu-font-size-title-medium)
}

<div class="text-error">Neutarl text</div>
<div class="text-neutral">Errored text</div>
```

#### Theming

Now imagine, you need now create a different theme, that is a bit more contrasted and has a bigger font.
To do that you need to create another set of variables, the same as the previous one but with updated values:

```css
--mu-font-size-title-medium: 15px; // bigger now
--mu-colors-foreground-text-critical-default: red;
--mu-colors-foreground-text-neutral-defailt: black; // new color
```

How about keeping these two variations of your values and toggling them within the runtime? This is exactly what MacawUI is doing for you.

#### MacawUI contract

MacawUI provides you with a set of design tokens, which you can reference in your code, that are swappable within the runtime.
Currently, we support only two themes "defaultDark" and "defaultLight". Each implements the same token contract but delivers a different set of values.
Switching the theme means changing one set of tokens to another.

#### Building components and using tokens

The most primitive element in MacawUI is the component `Box`.
This is a sort of wrapper for any HTML element where by using its props,
you can style it against our tokens.

```tsx
import { Box } from "@saleor/macaw-ui/next";

<Box as="div" fontSize="body" paddingX={2}>
  This is div!
</Box>;
```

Each property is type-checked against out design token contract. Your editor will show you suggestions when you type certain properties. Every component in MacawUI is built on top of this abstraction.

#### Enforcing custom values

We understand that sometimes there is a need to force using some custom-defined values.
You can achieve that by adding a double underscore to the `Box` properties.

```tsx
import { Box } from "@saleor/macaw-ui/next";

<Box as="div" __fontSize="30px">
  This is bigger!
</Box>;
```

Even if this is possible, please use it wisely as when you force locally some of the values, they will no longer be related to our tokens.
