# MacawUI

Official React UI components kit for [Saleor](https://saleor.io/) â€” an open-source GraphQL-first and Next.js ready e-commerce platform. You can find most of the elements used in the creation of Saleor's dashboard interface and use it to create Saleor Apps. Have a great time working on your projects and empowering your users. If you have any questions, feel free to let us know on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mirumee/saleor/discussions).

## Installation

```sh
npm i @saleor/macaw-ui
```

Note that this package still bundles the old version of MacawUI so it still depends on the following Material-UI v4 packages: @material-ui/core, @material-ui/icons and @material-ui/lab. If your project doesn't have them installed and you're not using npm v7 with [automatically installed peer dependencies](https://github.blog/2020-10-13-presenting-v7-0-0-of-the-npm-cli/) then you'll need to install them manually:

```sh
npm i @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab
```

## Usage

You need to import the styles into your app. You can do it in your main entry point, for example `index.`tsx`:

```tsx
import "@saleor/macaw-ui/next/style";
```

Next, you need to add the `ThemeProvider` to your app. It will provide the theme to the components:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@saleor/macaw-ui/next";

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <App />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

### Usage with Next.js

As mentioned above, we still bundle the old version of MacawUI so you need to add the following to your `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    esmExternals: false,
  },
};
```

It tells Next.js not to use ESM exports for external modules. This is needed because MacawUI dependencies (Material-UI v4) are still using CommonJS exports.

If you need to render styles on the server we recommend that you use `getCSSVariables` helper to get the CSS variables that can be injected in `_document.tsx`:

```tsx
import { getCSSVariables } from "@saleor/macaw-ui/next";
import Document, { Head, Html, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

const css = getCSSVariables("defaultLight"); // or "defaultDark"

export default class AppDocument extends Document {
  render() {
    return (
      <Html style={css}>
        <Head />
        <body>
          <Main />
          <NextScript />
        </body>
      </Html>
    );
  }
}
```

If you are using Next.js in version 13 and you got this error:

```
NonErrorEmittedError: (Emitted value instead of an instance of Error) ReferenceError: $RefreshReg$ is not defined
```

Try to change `sprinkles` imports from `@saleor/macaw-ui/next` to `@saleor/macaw-ui/next/theme`.

### Usage with form libraries

#### React Hook Form

You need to wrap the MacawUI component with [`Controller`](https://react-hook-form.com/api/usecontroller/controller/). For example:

```tsx
import { Input } from "@saleor/macaw-ui/next";

<Controller
  control={control}
  name="name-input"
  render={({ field }) => <Input {...field} />}
/>;
```

### Usage with Sentry

Add following configuration to `Sentry.Integrations.Breadcrumbs`:

```js
{
  dom: {
    serializeAttribute: ["macaw-ui-component"];
  }
}
```

Right now sentry will display MacawUI components names in breadcrumbs.

### Development

To begin, you need to install dependencies:

```sh
pnpm install
```

Then, you can run the Storybook:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

You can run build in watch mode (useful for real-time development with e.g Dashboard):

```sh
pnpm watch
```
